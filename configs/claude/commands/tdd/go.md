description: Advance TDD workflow using plan.md

Find the next unmarked test in plan.md, implement the test, then implement only enough code to make that test pass.

## Steps

1. Read plan.md to find the next unmarked test item
2. Write a failing test for that item (Red)
3. Implement the minimum code to make the test pass (Green)
4. Run all tests to confirm they pass
5. Consider if refactoring is needed (Refactor)
6. Mark the item as complete in plan.md

Use `tdd` skill for detailed methodology.
Use `git-commit` skill when ready to commit.
