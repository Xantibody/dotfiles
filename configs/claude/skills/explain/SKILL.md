# Explain

Summarize, explain, and validate the implementation.

## Explain these three points

1. **Why** - Why was this implemented? What problem does it solve?
2. **What** - What technologies/patterns were used? Why those choices?
3. **Granularity** - Is the current scope appropriate? Too broad? Too narrow?

## Validate

Check for consistency across the three points:

- Does the implementation match the stated goal?
- Are the technology choices appropriate for the problem?
- Is the granularity correct for maintainability?

If consistent: OK
If inconsistent: Recommend improvements
