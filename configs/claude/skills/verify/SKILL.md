# Verify

Run all verification checks to ensure code quality.

## Steps

1. Read README or Makefile to find available commands.

2. Run in this order:
   - `static-analysis` skill (linting and type checking)
   - `test` skill (run the test suite)
   - `format` skill (run code formatters)

3. Fix any issues before proceeding to the next step. Do not go back to completed steps.
