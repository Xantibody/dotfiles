# Static Analysis

Run linting and type checking to verify code correctness and quality.

## Steps

1. Read README, Makefile, or package.json to find the lint/check commands.

2. Run the linting command. If a separate type checking command exists, run both.

3. Fix any errors found before proceeding.
