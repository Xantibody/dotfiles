# Preview

Summarize, explain, and validate the implementation plan before coding.

## Explain these three points

1. **Why** - Why will this be implemented? What problem does it solve?
2. **What** - What technologies/patterns will be used? Why those choices?
3. **Granularity** - Is the planned scope appropriate? Too broad? Too narrow?

## Validate

Check for consistency across the three points:

- Does the plan match the stated goal?
- Are the technology choices appropriate for the problem?
- Is the granularity correct for maintainability?

If consistent: OK to proceed
If inconsistent: Recommend adjustments before implementation
