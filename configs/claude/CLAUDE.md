# Communication

- When asking questions with multiple options, always recommend one option as the first choice.
- Before moving to the next task, always ask if the user wants to commit the current changes.
- When committing, always use `/commit` skill to follow Conventional Commits format.

# Scripting Preferences

- When writing scripts for text processing, data manipulation, or automation, use Go instead of Perl or other scripting languages.
- For simple one-off tasks, write a small `main.go` and run it with `go run`.
- Do not use Perl one-liners or Perl scripts.
